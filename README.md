This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior and income patterns to optimize marketing strategies for a mall. It aims to deliver actionable insights for the marketing team to develop targeted campaigns for specific customer segments.

The analysis uses clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their income levels and shopping scores, creating distinct customer groups with the aim of providing a data-driven foundation for marketing decision-making and resource allocation.

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project examines customer demographics and behavioral patterns to identify meaningful trends. Statistical analysis and visualization techniques are employed to understand and represent different customer segments clearly.

Machine learning clustering techniques are used to create and validate customer segments for targeted marketing approaches.

The primary target identified (Cluster 1) consists of high-income customers with strong spending patterns, with 60% being female customers.
A secondary opportunity was identified in Cluster 3, specifically for sales event marketing strategies.

Recommendations include developing gender-specific marketing campaigns and sales events tailored to different customer segments' characteristics.
